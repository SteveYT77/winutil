# WinUtil

### Welcome to the WinUtil GitHub repository.
#### If you would like to know more about our project, please continue reading.

WinUtil is a small project made to make things easier for those who don't know a lot about *the command prompt, coding, and stuff similar to that.* Of course, this thing can't do magic, but it can do lots of stuff that users might want to shorten, or make easier! 

For example, restarting their file explorer if it has frozen, or deleting a file that can't be deleted with normal user permissions.

This, of course, is still a work in progress. We hope that soon, this becomes a bigger project than what we currently are, and that we can help tons of users that might need it.

Thanks for using WinUtil!
