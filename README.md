The Windows Multi Utilities (or WinUtil for short) is a small project made to make things easier for those who don't know a lot about *command prompt, coding, and stuff like that.* Of course, this thing can't do magic, but it can do lots of stuff that users might want to shorten, or make easier! 

For example, ***quickly opening a folder that is nested under lots of other folders, or maybe even restart their file explorer if it's frozen.***

![The UI can be seen here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteveYT77/winutil/main/winutil-media/ui.png "The look of the GUI.")

This, of course, is still a work in progress. We hope that soon, this becomes a bigger program than what we currently are, and that we can help tons of users that might need.

Thanks for using WinUtil!
