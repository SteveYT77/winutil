# Windows Multi-Utilities Tool
---
### The source code for WinUtil 2.0 is now public! However, it's highly unstable and really buggy, so acompiled version is not out yet. If you wish, you can compile the code yourself and try out the latest features while we finish the full release. The design is not finished yet, and most things are missing! We do NOT give support for the source code yet, do NOT ask us how to compile it or to fix any bugs. The rest of this README will not be updated until the stable version is ready. Thank you!

### Welcome to our GitHub!
#### If you would like to know more about our project, please continue reading.

The Windows Multi Utilities (or WinUtil for short) is a small project made to make things easier for those who don't know a lot about *command prompt, coding, and stuff like that.* Of course, this thing can't do magic, but it can do lots of stuff that users might want to shorten, or make easier! 

For example, ***quickly opening a folder that is nested under lots of other folders, or maybe even restart their file explorer if it's frozen.***

This, of course, is still a work in progress. We hope that soon, this becomes a bigger program than what we currently are, and that we can help tons of users that might need.

Thanks for using WinUtil!
